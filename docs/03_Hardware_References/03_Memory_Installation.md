UDOO BOLT features **2x 260-pin SO-DIMM** sockets for **DDR4** memory (CN2 and CN3).

* Supports **4GB**, **8GB** and **16GB** DDR4 SO-DIMMs up to **maximum 32GB**.
* Supports **1.2v DDR4-2400** DIMMs **ECC** and **non-ECC** memory with **dual channel** architecture.

Make sure that you install memory modules of the same type and density in different channel DIMM slots to exploit the Dual-Channel mode.

If you want to use only 1 DIMM you can install it into either DIMM slot CN2 or slot CN3.
If you want to use 2 DIMMs you can install it into both the DIMM slots CN2 and CN3.

### Memory Installation

DDR4 and DDR3 memory modules are physically different. Please only install DDR4 DIMMs on UDOO BOLT. To make sure you have the correct DIMM, check that all the notches line up with the DDR4 DIMM slot.

To install the DIMM, follow these steps:
* Pull both clips on either side of the slot outwards. Align the DIMM module with the slot.
* Press modules straight down until the plastic clips close and the module fits tightly into the DIMM slot. Push clips inwards to make sure they are in place.

To remove DIMM from a socket, gently spread the socketâ€™s retention arms to disengage them from the DIMM.  
Note: To avoid damaging the DIMM, do not touch its contact edge.
