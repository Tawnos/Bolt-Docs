UDOO BOLT features **2x 260-pin SO-DIMM** sockets for **DDR4** memory (CN2 and CN3).

* Supports **4GB**, **8GB** and **16GB** DDR4 SO-DIMMs up to **maximum 32GB**.
* Supports **1.2v DDR4-2400** DIMMs **ECC** and **non-ECC** memory with **dual channel** architecture.

In order to exploit the Dual-Channel mode make sure that you install memory modules of the same type and density in different channel DIMM slots.

If you want to use only 1 DIMM you can install it into either DIMM slot CN2 or slot CN3.
If you want to use 2 DIMMs you can install it into both the DIMM slots CN2 and CN3.

### Memory Installation

Please only install DDR4 DIMMs on UDOO BOLT. Only DDR4 are compatibles with UDOO BOLT, as there are physical differences between DDR3 and DDR4 memory modules. Check that all the notches line up with the DDR4 DIMM slot to ensure you have the correct DIMM.

Follow these steps to install the DIMM:
* Pull both clips on either side of the slot outwards. Align the DIMM module with the slot.
* Press the module straight down until the plastic clips tick and close. Ensure that the module fits tightly into the DIMM slot. Push the clips inwards to check.

DIMM removal from a socket: gently spread the socketâ€™s retention arms to disengage them from the DIMM.  

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span>  Do not touch the DIMM contact edge to avoid damaging it.
